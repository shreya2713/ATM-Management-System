# ATM-Management-System
ATM System Project Overview
Introduction
The ATM system is a software application developed in Python, designed to allow users to access their bank accounts and perform various transactions such as cash withdrawals and balance inquiries. This system ensures secure transactions by requiring users to enter their personal identification number (PIN) and ATM card number for validation.

Features
Cash Withdrawals:

Users can withdraw cash in denominations of 100’s, 500’s, and 2000’s.
The amount withdrawn will be debited from the user's account balance.

Balance Enquiry:

Users can check the balance of any account linked to their ATM card.

User Authentication:

Users must enter their ATM card number and PIN.
These credentials are validated against the database to ensure security.

Transaction Verification:

Each transaction is communicated to the database for verification.
If a transaction fails due to reasons other than an invalid PIN, the ATM provides an explanation and allows the user to attempt another transaction.
Workflow

User Authentication:

The user inserts their ATM card and enters their PIN.
The ATM sends the card number and PIN to the database for validation.
If the PIN is invalid, the user is prompted to re-enter it.

Performing Transactions:

Upon successful authentication, the user can choose to perform a transaction (cash withdrawal or balance enquiry).
For a cash withdrawal, the user selects the amount, and the ATM disburses the cash in specified denominations.
The transaction details are sent to the database for verification and completion.

Database Interaction:

The ATM communicates with the database to validate the user's credentials and verify transaction permissions.
Post-transaction, the database is updated with the new account balance and transaction details.

Technology
Language: Python

Python is a powerful object-oriented programming language, chosen for its readability, simplicity, and extensive libraries that facilitate the development of secure and efficient applications.

Conclusion

The ATM system is designed to provide a secure and user-friendly interface for bank customers to access their accounts and perform transactions. With robust authentication mechanisms and seamless database integration, the system ensures the integrity and security of user data and transactions.
